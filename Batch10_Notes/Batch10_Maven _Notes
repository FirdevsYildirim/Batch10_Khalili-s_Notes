Subject: 	Maven

Teacher: 	Marofjon 

-> Maven: 
	- We need to know about development of application and it is important for the future to use that skill in test environment. 

How Application are written and deployed? 

	-> We have requirement first to write an application, we design the application, develop the code, test the code, produce the code, reproduce the code, make sure it is working fine, then send them to the testers for further testing purposes, once all STLC is done, then we will develop another functionality until it is ready for the release. Basically, it will be going on like a cycle and the same process will be continued. 

Developing the Code: -> only dedicated for Web-Developers. 

	- Create project 
	- create some packages 

	- Write some code 
	- write unit test for code 
	- run unit tests 
	- run unit tests 
	- push your code / deploy 

-> The process above used to be done manually before, it is called BUILD PROCESS and recently with using of the new tools like Maven, Selenium to Automate the BUILD PROCESS. 

-> Tools used for Automating the build process: Mavaen, Gradel, Ant. In Java Environment, but in other environment, there are some other tools that are used for automation purposes. 

Maven: -> It is a Build Automation tool specific to Java Environment. Maven is good for creating new project and you can see the librarries, you can see the compilation, Running the Test (there is no need to write click and run the test, it will be run automatically), Deploying will be done automatically, we can also use Maven a little in our Testing Environment. 

Selenium: Only used for Automtion Test, the rest of the tools including Maven is used for the Web-Development purposes. 

Maven: -> It is command line tool, mvn is the main Maven command. It does not have the installer, 

Maven Keywords: 

1): 

Important Terms: 

-> home folder == home directory: 
-> user folder == user directory: It is the folder that you put your username and pasword, better not to save anything in this folder too. User folder is special directory created for the account you log-in and if you use MacBook, it is under the users/yourMacBookname. 

		-> for my Mac: 		/Users/cybertekschool 
		-> for Windows: 	C:\Users\cybertekschool 

-> Every computer has a root folder and a home folder, if you use Widows your root folder is Driver C (C: Driver) and if you use MacBook then your root folder is. It is recommended not to put anything in your root folder.  

-> Tools like maven are installed be created in directory, but they will used 

-> mvn archetype:generate -> that means that we ask maven, can you please create a new project, Maven knows thousands of project and we have to create a proejct version that Maven create it for us. 

-> Next do not enter any number, just hit enter, it means use the default one. 

-> Junit: is a Maven project, the package name is: 		org.junit.Assert.*;  

-> All Maven commands start with mvn. 

-> groupId: -> name of the package 

-> artificates: 

-> Any command you do with Maven, you build something, the outcome will be BUILD SUCCESS  or BUILD FAILURE. If it is failure then it will have some error messages. 

-> Maven Life Cycle also known as Maven Goal: There are differen Maven operations regarding to the compiling, building, testing, deploying, the project. The life cycle is what you do with the project. 
		
	1) - mvn compile: It will compile to project, projects don't get compiled by themselves, we don't see it, but behind the seens, other tools like maven helps compiling. After running this, a new file will be created that is called target. 

	target: All the compiled code and reports generated by maven will be sorted inside the target folder. 

	2) - mvn test: It runs the units of the projects.  
 
 -> When you compile, you type: 	mvn compile 

 -> In order to run any Maven LifeCycle, you have to be in project directory or project folder, you should not be in home directory. project is highest level folder. It is a package 

 -> you can write: 	 cd macbook$ cd first-maven-app/ 

 -> When you compile, it will catch all compilation error and it will fail, but it will not catch the Bug. 

 -> mvn clean: It is used to delete the target folder and all generated sources, reports. So, it is the opposite of mvn compile. 

 -> Why as an Automation Test Engineer we need mvn: 

 	1): We will run tests and get reports using maven in the future using the maven test command.

 	2):  

 -> Usually whatever the tools are used in different companies, maven is one of the importants one in testing environment. 

 -> When you install eclips or intellije, maven is coming with it. When you go to work, it is usually empty laptop, you have to install everything from the begining. 

 -> Intellije: 
 1. Open Intellije 
 2. File -> go to File -> New -> Project 
 3. pick maven 
 4. Click Next 
 5. Enter group id- com.cybertek 
 6. enter artifact-id: maven-project-z
 7. hit enter 

 pom.xml: it is called pom file and it is created when we create maven project, it is allways at the top level project. pom file is the most important file in any maven project, it is the command center of the project and basically everything in maven project is processed by pom file. 

 Why we need (pom.xml) pom file? 

 	-> In any maven project, inside src (source), we have main and test folders, all the application codes are written in the main folder. All tests (unit tests, functional selenium test) are written in the test folder. (if you share your folder with Developers, then you use the test folder, they use the main folder). 

 	-> In pom file we manage our dependencies for the projet, 

 		- you have to write  <dependencies> to access other people's code from internet legally. It is like jar file that people thier files in internet. 

 		- It is better to use the following website:  https://mvnrepository.com/

Absolute : if you go from the html to head, body 

relative xpath; it looks through the whole document and then get teh required ifnomration. It starts with //input 

findElement: will find 1 element 

findElements will find multiple elements

xpath is costumizable, you can pick any option that you want
